When the agent starts up, the goal to be achieve is pushed onto a stack, called 
the ğŸ‘‰ intention stack.
This stacks contains all the ğŸ‘‰ goals that are pending achievement.
The agent then searches through its plan library to see that plans
have the goal on the top of the intention stack as their post condition.

Plan structure ğŸ‘‰ goal: context <- body

The set of plans that 
    ğŸ‘‰ achieve the goal
    ğŸ‘‰ have their context (i.e., their pre-conditions) satisfied
become the possible ğŸ‘‰ options for the agent

The process of selecting between different possible plans is called ğŸ‘‰ deliberation.
