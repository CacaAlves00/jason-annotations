# Beer Robot

A domestic robot has the goal of serving beer to its owner. Its mission
is quite simple, it just receives some beer requests from the owner, goes
to the fridge, takes out a bottle of beer, and brings it back to the owner.
However, the robot should also be concerned with the beer stock (and
eventually order more beer using the supermarketâ€™s home delivery ser-
vice) and some rules hard-wired into the robot by the Department of
Health (in this example this rule defines the limit of daily beer con-
sumption).
